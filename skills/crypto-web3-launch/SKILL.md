# Crypto / Web3 Launch & Explainer

> **THE LOOK IS APPLE STANDARD — MANDATORY AND THE ONLY OPTION.**
> Every graphic, card, caption and colour in this video uses the Apple Standard

**Scope.** Launch films (30–90 s), protocol explainers (60–120 s), community/AMA reels (15–45 s), roadmap and ecosystem updates.

**Asset tier: 1–2.** Tier 1 = an animated explainer and kinetic launch film are synthesizable from the client's facts. Tier 2 = founder/community footage, real product captures and any numbers/metrics need the client's own files. **Ask first.**

## STEP 0 — SOURCE GATE (mandatory, BEFORE the assets prompt)

**You cannot plan assets without the material.** Before writing
`ASSETS-PROMPT.md`, obtain at least ONE of:

1. **the video clip** — the footage to edit, or
2. **the voiceover / audio** — the narration track, or
3. **the transcript / script** — the words.

Ask for it up front. If the build is genuinely from-scratch graphics (no source
exists), say so and record it — the concept you write becomes the script.

**Then analyse the source and save the evidence** as `SOURCE-ANALYSIS.json`:

- **If a clip -> video analytics:** `ffprobe` (codec, size, fps, duration, audio
  channels); scene detection for cut times and ASL
  (`ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -filter:v "select='gt(scene,0.3)',showinfo" -f null -`);
  loudness (integrated LUFS + true peak); palette sample (quantise frames ->
  hex); beat/BPM if there is music.
- **If audio -> word-level transcription:** faster-whisper with
  `word_timestamps=True` -> a JSON of `{word, start, end}` per word, plus
  segments. This drives the Visual Narration Plan, the captions and the word
  sync. Recipe: decode to 16 kHz mono WAV with ffmpeg, pass a numpy array, run
  with `MKL_THREADING_LAYER=GNU OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` and `cpu_threads=1`, model
  `tiny` (base/small for accuracy).
- **If text only ->** the sentence list, mapped to the Sentence Law table.

**Only once the source is in hand and analysed** do you write
`ASSETS-PROMPT.md` — so every prompt reflects what the build actually needs.

## STEP 1 — CONCEPT.md (write the plan before any prompt)

With the source analysed, write **CONCEPT.md** — the plan the whole build follows:
- **Premise** — the video in one sentence + its emotional arc.
- **Style** — Apple Standard (or the preset in use) and how it applies here.
- **Segment plan** — the beat map with timings, taken from the analysis.
- **Scene table** — sentence -> visual concept -> lane (D speaker / E visual) ->
  timing -> element bindings -> camera.
- **Visual narration plan** — every spoken concept and the visual that shows it.
- **Sync map** — the word-level timings that drive text and visuals.
- **Asset manifest** — what the build needs; this feeds STEP 2.

Then STEP 2 writes `ASSETS-PROMPT.md` from this plan.

## ASSETS-PROMPT.md — MANDATORY (strict rule)

After the concept, produce ONE file — **`ASSETS-PROMPT.md`** — listing every
asset the build needs, **one executable brief per item**, addressed to **an AI
agent that has image generation, audio generation AND coding**. No prompt list,
no build.

1. **Images** — image briefs: subject · composition · style · palette (hex) ·
   lighting · aspect + background · negatives.
2. **Transparent images (PNG/alpha)** — briefs ending "transparent background,
   PNG with alpha, no background".
3. **Logos** — a brief, or "client supplies".
4. **Music** — audio briefs: mood · genre · BPM · length · instrumentation.
5. **Sound effects** — audio briefs: type · character · duration.
6. **Code components** — CODING briefs for what code does best (glass cards,
   animated type, diagrams, count-ups, UI mockups, particles, shaders, 3D):
   exact values (hex, px, easing, durations), the motion, and the
   **nested-zip deliverable**: ONE master zip containing a zip per category and
   a zip per component kit (each kit unzips to `index.html`, `styles.css`,
   `README.md`, `assets/`, palette exposed as CSS variables).

**This file IS the prompt** — write it as a self-contained instruction you
hand straight to the agent, ending with the deliverable tree (one zip) and
acceptance checks. A full worked example: `EXAMPLE-ASSETS-PROMPT.md`.

**EXCLUDED — never in this file:** **voiceover** and **ALL video clips**
(A-roll and B-roll). The user supplies the A-roll — voice, primary footage, or a
transcription JSON — at the start. If the build needs any **B-roll clip**, ask
the user for it **separately**; clips are never listed in this prompt file.
(The agent can only generate images, audio and code — it cannot generate video.)

Full format, the kit shape, and a worked example: `ASSET-REQUEST-GUIDE.md`.

## 1. Intake — ask before you build
One batch, every question skippable; unanswered = marked ASSUMPTION.
1. What is the product/protocol, and what ONE thing does it do better for the user?
2. Format: launch film, explainer, community reel or update? Audience: retail, developers or institutions?
3. Which numbers (TVL, users, supply, dates) may be shown, with source and as-of date?
4. Which risk/regulatory disclosures are required in the target jurisdictions?
5. Brand kit, product captures, community footage?

Then emit **ASSET-REQUEST.md**:
```
# ASSET REQUEST — <project>
## Facts & metrics (MANDATORY) — each with source, link and as-of date
## Required risk disclosures (MANDATORY) — verbatim
## Product captures / UI — real, not mocked unless disclosed
## Brand — logo, colours, fonts, token/mark usage rules
## Community/founder footage (optional)
## Music & SFX — prompts in ASSETS-PROMPT.md
```
Tier 2 elements: STOP and wait for the client's real files. Never fabricate a real person, listing, event or testimonial.

## 2. Structure
- **Hook (0–3 s):** the problem or promise in one line, motion on the first frame.
- **What it is (3–20 s):** one diagram showing flow of value/steps.
- **Why it matters (20–45 s):** 2–3 benefits with real metrics.
- **How to start (45–60 s):** one action; link/URL.
- **Disclosure (last 4 s):** risk wording, legible.

## 3. The look — THE APPLE STANDARD (mandatory; the only look)

This pack has **one look**. Every skill uses the Apple Standard — there is no
other palette, type system, or motion grammar. Verticals differ only in **what
the graphics depict** and **which single accent carries meaning**; never in the
underlying system. Any other palette named anywhere in this file is deprecated.

- **Canvas:** alternating `#ffffff` / `#f5f5f7` bands — the colour change IS the
  divider (no borders, no rules). Dark variant `#0d0d0f` with glow
  `rgba(10,132,255,.25)`.
- **Text:** `#1d1d1f` primary · `#6e6e73` secondary · `#86868b` tertiary ·
  hairlines `#d2d2d7` on light, `#333` on dark.
- **The one blue — interactive only, never decoration:** filled action
  `#0071e3` · text links `#0066cc` on light · `#2997ff` on dark. Hover wash
  `#e8e8ed`. Icon gradient `#41A6FF -> #0A64E8` at 180°.
- **Type (Inter stands in for SF Pro):** hero 80px/600/-1.2px · display
  56px/600/-0.28px · section 40px/600 · **body 17px/400/25px/-0.374px** ·
  small 14px/-0.224px · caption 12px. **Negative tracking at EVERY size.** One
  accent word per headline, never whole lines.
- **Buttons:** pill radius **980px**, filled `#0071e3`, white text, 44px tall,
  11px 21px padding (compact 36px/14px); outline twin 1px `#0066cc`. **One CTA
  per scene, maximum.**
- **Shadow:** one light source. Cards `0 24px 60px rgba(0,0,0,.08)` + hairline
  `rgba(0,0,0,.055)`; icons `0 30px 70px rgba(10,100,232,.35)` + inner highlight
  `inset 0 2px 6px rgba(255,255,255,.45)`. Shadow on the focal element only.
- **Radii:** cards 28-32px · icons ~26% of size · pills 980px · inner UI
  12-16px · never below 10px. Spacing on the 8px grid; card padding 34-40px.
- **Frosted bar** (nav / chapter strip): `rgba(250,250,252,.8)` + backdrop blur,
  44px tall, 1px hairline `#d2d2d7` beneath.
- **Motion:** springs with 5-8% overshoot; every entrance = fade + rise +
  scale-settle (0.5->1) + deblur 12-18px->0; stagger 0.05-0.16s; exits scale to
  ~1.05 with blur 8; camera push-ins <=8% over 3-5s. **Never linear.**
- **Layout:** symmetric, centred, one focal point, >=30% whitespace, <=6
  elements per scene.

**Vertical application for this skill:** the tech is explained in Apple-clean cards and diagrams; the accent carries the token/feature. No neon cyberpunk.
## 4. The edit
- Fast cuts 1–2 s for launch, 3–5 s for explainers; kinetic type lands on beats.
- Diagrams draw on the narration, one concept per step.
- Count-ups finish on the spoken number; label units and chain/network.
- Never show price charts as implied predictions.

## 5. Audio
Electronic bed 100–140 BPM for launch, minimal for explainers; SFX on diagram steps. Voice highest. −14 LUFS YouTube/X, −16 social, −1 dBTP.

## Industry benchmarks (working conventions)
- Launch 30–60 s; explainer 60–120 s; community reel 15–45 s; X/Twitter autoplay often muted, so rely on visual mapping.
- Every metric: source + as-of date on screen.
- Risk disclosure ≥ 4 s on screen, ≥ ~24 px at 1080p.
- Provide captions (SRT) and a 9:16 cut.

## Worked example
**Example — 45 s protocol explainer**
| t | Beat | Edit |
|---|---|---|
| 0–3 | Hook | "Swap without a middleman" text, glitch-in |
| 3–20 | How it works | 3-node flow diagram draws on narration ① |
| 20–35 | Proof | client metric count-up with source + date ① |
| 35–41 | Start | URL pill, one CTA |
| 41–45 | Disclosure | verbatim risk text |

## Common mistakes to avoid
- Implying profit or price targets.
- Metrics without source/date.
- Fake UI mockups presented as the real product.
- Hype language for numbers instead of stating them.

## Visual narration layer — full spec (mandatory wherever a person speaks)
The market-dominant format: the speaker carries the voice, the **visuals carry the
meaning**. Whoever is speaking — on camera, walking, or voiceover — the video
must SHOW what is being said.

### Three placements (choose per beat, alternate them)
1. **Full-screen cutaway** — visual takes the frame (icon, diagram, stat count-up,
   keyword card, B-roll). Voice continues (L-cut in, J-cut out). Best for concepts,
   numbers, lists, comparisons.
2. **Front overlay** — motion graphics over the speaker; face stays visible
   (labels, keyword pops, callouts, arrows, lower-thirds). Best for emphasis,
   naming, quick facts.
3. **Behind / around the subject** — speaker keyed/cut-out over graphic background
   or blurred plate, elements animating behind and beside. Best for intros, hero
   segments, brand pieces. Needs a clean cut-out or a clean plate (Tier 1–2 asset).

### Rules
- Every spoken concept gets a visual landing on the exact word (±100 ms).
- One visual event every 6–10 s; no talking frame static > ~8 s.
- Alternate placements; avoid 3 of the same in a row.
- **Captions are additive, never the layer** — remove them and the ideas must still show.
- One idea per visual. Motion: fade + rise + settle, eased, never linear (180–450 ms in, 250–350 ms out).
- Never hide the speaker's face when the face is the message.
- Zero-speech pieces: apply the same layer to on-screen kinetic text.

### The Visual Narration Plan (write BEFORE cutting)
A table with one row per spoken idea:
| Timecode | Spoken phrase (exact word to land on) | Concept | Placement 1/2/3 | Visual | Duration | Sound |
Rules for the plan: ≥ 1 row per 6–10 s; no more than two consecutive rows with the
same placement; every number gets a stat visual; every named thing gets a label
or cutaway; every list gets a build-in with one item per spoken item.

### Beat micro-timings
- Keyword pop lands 0–80 ms **before** the audible word onset (the eye leads the ear).
- Count-ups run 0.6–1.0 s and finish on the spoken number.
- Lower-third: in at first speech, on screen 4–5 s, out ≥ 0.3 s before the next cut.
- Cutaway length = the length of the spoken idea (usually 2–5 s); return to speaker on the sentence boundary.

## Signature techniques for this style (use these, with the recipes below)
- **Apple clean-technical system** — one accent only; a subtle RGB split on beats (sparingly, recipes 4, 21).
- **Flow diagrams that draw** node-to-node on narration (SVG/GSAP via HyperFrames).
- **Metric count-ups with source + as-of date**, chain/network named.
- **Shader-style transitions** (flash-through-white, glitch) — one signature, reused sparingly.
- **Real product capture or labelled mock UI**; never imply live results from a mock.
- **Verbatim risk disclosure** ≥ 4 s; no price-prediction visuals.

## Modern editing toolkit (techniques editors use today + how to do them from the terminal)

### A. The technique catalogue — what top editors actually reach for
**Cutting & structure** — jump cut · J-cut / L-cut · match cut (shape, motion, colour) · smash cut · cutaway/insert · split edit · cut-on-beat montage · invisible cut hidden by a whip, zoom or object wipe · freeze frame · reverse · seamless loop · transcript-based rough cut · silence/filler removal · multicam switching.
**Motion & camera** — eased punch-in/push-in · slow digital push · pan/tilt on stills (Ken Burns) · 2.5D parallax from separated layers · camera shake on impacts · speed ramp / time remap · optical-flow slow-motion · stabilisation · whip pan · simulated dolly-zoom · motion blur on fast moves.
**Transitions** — hard cut is the default; then push/slide, whip, zoom-through, shape/mask reveal, luma wipe, light-leak/flash, glitch/RGB split, crossfade. Every transition has a matching sound. Never repeat the same transition twice in a row.
**Text & captions** — kinetic typography · word-by-word karaoke captions · one-accent-word highlight · animated lower-thirds · text tracked to a moving object · **text behind the subject** (matte) · typewriter/mask reveals · drawn-on callouts and arrows · count-up numbers.
**Compositing & depth** — subject cut-out/matting · background blur/replace · split-screen · picture-in-picture · chroma/luma key · screen replacement (UI on a device) · shadow + reflection under cut-outs · glow/bloom · overlays (grain, dust, light leaks) · blend modes (screen, add, multiply).
**Colour & look** — correct first (exposure, white balance), then log→Rec.709, LUT, contrast curve, secondary tweaks (skin, sky), split-tone/film emulation, halation/bloom, grain, vignette, letterbox (2.39:1), shot matching. Protect skin tones.
**Audio design** — dialogue chain (high-pass → denoise → de-ess → compress → loudnorm) · side-chain ducking · SFX layer (whoosh, impact, riser, tick, sub-drop) · ambience/room tone · music edited to phrases · a 0.2–0.4 s silence before the drop · stem separation for cleanup.
**Graphics & data** — animated charts with a single highlight colour · count-ups · map/route draws · diagrams that draw on the narration · UI demo with eased cursor + click ripple · stat "bento" grids · progress bars · timeline graphics.
**AI-assisted (2026)** — word-level transcription · filler/silence removal · scene detection · auto-chapters · face-tracked auto-reframe · matting/rotoscope · upscaling · frame interpolation · stem separation · beat detection · generative B-roll/imagery (disclose when real footage is implied).

### B. Terminal toolchain (pick the lightest tool that does the job)
| Tool | Use it for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **FFmpeg / ffprobe** | cuts, concat, scale/crop, zoom, xfade transitions, speed ramps, LUT/grade, grain/glow, overlays, captions (ASS), audio chain, loudness, export | The backbone. Chain edits in ONE `filter_complex` pass to avoid generation loss. |
| **auto-editor** | rough cut by removing silence/dead air via loudness/motion analysis | Signal analysis, not generative. |
| **faster-whisper / WhisperX** | transcription with word-level timestamps (captions, beat plans, filler cuts) | Needed for ±100 ms word sync. |
| **PySceneDetect / ffmpeg `select='gt(scene,0.3)'`** | find shot boundaries in source footage | |
| **librosa** (Python) | BPM + beat timestamps for cut-on-beat | |
| **HyperFrames (HeyGen, Apache-2.0)** | motion graphics as HTML/CSS/GSAP/Lottie/Three.js → deterministic MP4; CLI `init`, `preview`, `lint`, `render` | Agent-friendly: `npx hyperframes init my-video` → edit `index.html` → `npx hyperframes render`. |
| **Remotion** (React) | code-defined video compositions, data-driven templates | Check its licence terms for company/commercial use. |
| **MoviePy** (Python) | scripted clip assembly where FFmpeg graphs get unwieldy | Slower than raw FFmpeg. |
| **rembg / Robust Video Matting / SAM-family** | subject cut-out (alpha) for text-behind-subject and layered looks | Check each model's licence (some are non-commercial). Review edges/hair; rembg is per-frame (flicker risk), RVM is temporally consistent. |
| **MediaPipe** | face tracking for auto-reframe to 9:16 | |
| **Demucs** | separate vocals/music for cleanup | |
| **Blender (headless `blender -b -P script.py`)** | 3D titles, product/architecture renders, camera moves | Heavy; use only when 3D is the point. |
| **MLT/melt, GStreamer, OpenTimelineIO** | timeline-style assembly and interchange | Optional; not needed for most jobs. |
| **ImageMagick / Pillow** | stills, masks, cards, contact sheets | |
*Always check what is installed first and fall back to FFmpeg-only:* `for t in ffmpeg ffprobe python3 node npx auto-editor scenedetect melt blender; do command -v $t >/dev/null && echo "have $t" || echo "missing $t"; done`. If the network is off, do not plan on installing anything.

### C. Tested FFmpeg recipe cookbook (verified on FFmpeg 6.1.1; confirm a filter exists with `ffmpeg -filters | grep <name>`)
Set `IN=input.mp4`. All outputs add `-c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p` (+ audio as needed).

```
**Rules that prevent bad renders:** conform every source to the same fps/size/pixel format before xfade/concat · work from proxies (720p) while iterating, render masters once · chain filters in one pass · never mix variable-frame-rate screen recordings (convert with `-vsync cfr -r 30`) · keep a 1.1–1.2× scale margin before any crop-based move to avoid black edges · use `-ss` before `-i` for fast seeking, after `-i` for frame accuracy.

### D. The production loop (every job)
1. **Probe** inputs (`ffprobe -v error -show_entries stream=codec_name,width,height,r_frame_rate,duration -of json`). 2. **Transcribe** with word timestamps. 3. **Plan**: write the cut list + Visual Narration Plan (timecode, phrase, placement, visual, sound) as a table or JSON. 4. **Rough cut** (silence/filler removal, scene boundaries). 5. **Motion graphics** rendered separately (HTML/HyperFrames/Remotion or FFmpeg drawtext/overlay) with alpha where they sit over footage. 6. **Composite + grade + sound design.** 7. **Loudness + export.** 8. **Verify like a viewer**: extract frames at key beats (`ffmpeg -ss T -i out.mp4 -frames:v 1 f_T.png`), make a contact sheet, check safe zones, check captions against the transcript, re-measure loudness. Fix and re-render; never ship unseen.

### E. What makes it feel premium (rules, not effects)
- **One system:** one palette, one type pair, one motion grammar, one transition vocabulary per video. Consistency reads as expensive.
- **Ease everything:** entrances `cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)`, transforms `cubic-bezier(0.65,0,0.35,1)`, playful overshoot `cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1)`. Never linear.
- **Depth:** separate foreground / mid / background; add soft shadows, subtle parallax (≤ 3–6% travel), grain 5–12% and a gentle vignette.
- **Hierarchy:** one focal point per frame, ≥ 30% negative space, max ~6 elements.
- **Rhythm:** vary shot length; land graphics and cuts on beats/words; let important moments breathe.
- **Sound sells picture:** a sound for every cut and graphic land; the quiet before the hit.
- **Restraint:** effects serve the idea. If it doesn't clarify or emphasise, delete it.
- **Polish:** no audio pops, no jitter, no black edges, no text outside safe zones, no single-frame flashes.

## Hybrid premium style & advanced feature pack

### H1. What "hybrid" means (observed in six premium reference videos)
Text and graphics are treated as **objects inside the scene**, not captions laid on top. Footage, 3D/AI renders, UI cards and kinetic type share one visual system. Devices seen across the references:
1. **Hierarchy inside one line** — a small lead-in word and one huge keyword (e.g. "here's the branding secret" small → "no one tells you" large).
2. **Single accent colour** (red, gold, orange or brand blue) against a controlled base (white, black or one graded footage look) with soft shadows and glow for depth.
3. **Words appear on the spoken beat** with blur-in/rise-in; the key word gets the accent colour and the largest size.
4. **Text integrated with the subject** — text arcs/wraps around the speaker, sits behind them (matte), or tracks an object; accent glow or flash on impact words.
5. **UI-as-graphics** — stat cards (64%, $50k), badges, toggles, a search bar that types "Comment ___", cursor/hand pointer, app-icon orbit, mind-map nodes.
6. **Hero objects** — 3D or AI-generated renders (statue, badge, product, device mock) on clean backgrounds, slow push + soft shadow.
7. **Hidden cuts** — a whip, flash, starburst/ribbon sweep, zoom-through or object wipe covers the edit; the hard cut is invisible.
8. **Before/After or phone-frame framing** — split-screen labelled panels, or a phone-shaped inset over a blurred, enlarged copy of the same footage.
9. **Matched cinematic B-roll** graded to the same look as the talking head; the speaker may be cloned/multiplied for emphasis.
10. **Comment-keyword CTA** ("Comment 'folder'") and a brand end card with a soft focus-pull.
**Pace:** a new visual event every 1–2.5 s (measured cut ASL 2.3–3.2 s, but most changes were in-scene motion, not cuts). **Audio:** speech forward, bass-heavy bed, impact/whoosh hits on the key-word slams; delivered around −14 LUFS.

### H2. How much of it to use ("hybrid dial") — decide per job
**0** = none (clean, regulated, calm) · **1** = light (accent colour, hierarchy lines, subtle push) · **2** = medium (+ UI cards, stat count-ups, hidden-cut transitions) · **3** = full (+ behind-subject text, 3D/AI hero objects, glow/flash, phone-frame, tracked text). Ask the client which dial; default is given in "Hybrid dial for this skill" below. Higher dial = more assets required (see H4) and more render time.

### H3. Editor feature → terminal equivalent (NLE checklist)
| Editor feature | In the terminal |
|---|---|
| Cut / split / trim | `trim` + `setpts`, or `cutlist.py` clips (in/out) |
| **Ripple edit** (close the gap) | delete the clip from the cut list — concat closes the gap |
| **Slip** (change content, keep position/length) | shift `in` and `out` by the same amount |
| **Slide** (move a clip, neighbours keep length) | reorder/shift entries in the cut list |
| **Copy/paste attributes** | reuse the same `vf` string/preset for many clips (store presets in one file) |
| Speed / ramp / slow-mo | `setpts`, split+concat ramp (recipe 3), `minterpolate` |
| Colour correct / LUT / contrast / saturation | `eq`, `curves`, `colorbalance`, `lut3d` (recipe 5) |
| **Sharpen / blur** | `unsharp` (recipe 23), `gblur`, `boxblur` |
| Film grain / vignette / glow | recipe 4 |
| **Light leaks / lens flares** | generated gradient overlay + `blend=screen` (recipes 24–25) |
| Transitions (fade, whip, zoom, glitch, match) | `xfade`, recipes 2, 7, 21, 31 |
| Keyframes: zoom, pan, **opacity, position** | expressions in `scale`/`crop`/`overlay` with `t` (recipes 1, 26) |
| **Object tracking (text follows subject)** | `track_text.py` (OpenCV CSRT → ASS positions) |
| Subtitles / kinetic type | ASS from word timestamps (recipe 13), HTML/GSAP via HyperFrames |
| Lower thirds / callouts | drawtext / PNG overlay with eased entrance (recipes 12, 26) |
| **Emoji / sticker pop** | transparent PNG overlay with scale-pop timing (recipe 26); never rely on system emoji fonts in drawtext |
| Audio: music sync, SFX, denoise, EQ, ducking | recipes 17, 18, librosa beats |
| Jump cuts / silence removal | auto-editor or `silencedetect` (recipe 19) |
| Pattern interrupts / B-roll / loop ending | recipes 1, 3, 15, 27 |
| **Green screen (chroma key)** | `chromakey` + `despill` (recipe 22) |
| **Masking & reveal** | animated `alphamerge` mask (recipe 28) |
| **Depth blur / fake bokeh** | radial-mask blur (recipe 29) |
| Letterbox | recipe 8 |
| **Proxy editing** | recipe 36 |
| Multicam | cut list across several sources + audio-energy/transcript switching |
| Presets/templates | keep a presets folder (LUTs, ASS styles, `vf` strings, HTML templates) |
| Auto subtitles (AI) | faster-whisper / WhisperX → SRT + ASS |

### H4. Hybrid-style asset request (ASK THE CLIENT — never fabricate)
At dial 2–3, add these to ASSET-REQUEST.md and wait for them (or confirm the AI may generate/synthesize each):
- **Brand kit:** the accent colour, base colours, 1–2 fonts, logo (SVG/PNG with transparency), end-card wording and the comment-keyword CTA.
- **Script/transcript with the key word of each line** marked (the one word that gets the accent).
- **Subject files:** the speaker/product footage; for behind-subject or cut-out looks either a **green-screen shot**, a **clean background plate**, or permission to run a matting model (check its licence).
- **Hero objects:** 3D renders, AI images or product packshots **with transparent background** (PNG/WebM-alpha), or approval to use generated placeholders (disclosed).
- **UI assets:** real screenshots/screen recordings, logo/icon set, names and figures to show on cards (each with source/date).
- **Sound pack:** whoosh, impact, riser, click, pop, sub-drop (licensed) and the music bed.
- **References:** 1–3 videos whose look is wanted (we match the system, never copy the content).
If an asset is missing and cannot be generated honestly, **lower the dial**, say so, and list what unlocks the next level.

**Not testable with FFmpeg alone — build these in HTML/CSS/GSAP/Three.js (HyperFrames or Remotion) or request assets:** text arcing/wrapping around a subject in 3D, particle-dissolve text, 3D camera moves on hero objects, app-icon orbit, mind-map/UI motion, speaker cloning/"many arms", AI-generated hero renders. Render those layers with transparency, then composite with FFmpeg (overlay) and grade the whole. These approaches are documented but were not executed in this pack's test run — render a 2-second test and inspect frames before building the full video.

### H6. Scripts (tested)
**`cutlist.py` — NLE-style edits in one FFmpeg pass.**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Cut-list renderer: NLE-style edits (ripple, slip, slide, speed, per-clip filters) -> one FFmpeg run.

edit.json = {"fps":30,"size":[1080,1920],"clips":[{"src":"a.mp4","in":0.0,"out":3.0,"speed":1.0,"vf":""}, ...]}
Ripple delete = remove a clip from the list (gap closes automatically).  Slip = change in/out by the same amount (length unchanged).
Slide = reorder/shift clips; neighbours' lengths are untouched. Copy attributes = reuse the same "vf" string."""

**`track_text.py` — make text follow a moving object (OpenCV CSRT).** Requires `opencv-contrib-python`. Tracker can drift on fast motion/occlusion: review, re-seed the box, split into shots.

### H7. Motion rules for the hybrid look
- Entrance: blur 10–18 px → 0, rise 20–40 px, scale 0.9 → 1, over 0.25–0.45 s with ease-out (`cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)`); exit faster (0.2–0.3 s).
- Key word: accent colour, 1.6–2.5× the lead-in size; land within ±100 ms of the spoken word (eye leads the ear by up to 80 ms).
- Impact words: 2-frame flash or glow pulse + low hit; never flash faster than 3 per second.
- Hidden cut recipe: start the whip/flash/sweep 3–5 frames before the cut and finish 3–5 frames after; put the whoosh on the first frame of motion.
- Depth: soft shadow under every card/object, background slightly desaturated or blurred, ≤ 6% parallax.
- Keep ≥ 30% negative space, ≤ 6 elements per frame, and keep text inside the platform text-safe zone.
- Do not copy a creator's specific artwork, brand or wording. Match the *system* (hierarchy, rhythm, motion), never the content.

### H8. Hybrid dial for this skill
**Default dial: 3: accent glow, subtle glitch on beats, flow-diagram draws, UI cards; risk disclosure verbatim.** Ask the client to confirm; if they have not supplied the H4 assets, drop one level and say what unlocks the next.

## WHICH LANE IS THE A-ROLL? (function, not source)

**A-roll = whatever carries the meaning. B-roll = whatever supports it.** The
lane is defined by FUNCTION, never by whether it came off a camera.

- In a **talking-head** piece the speaker is the A-roll; graphics and footage
  are B-roll.
- In a **graphics-led** piece — the motion graphics carrying the argument, the
  footage used as cutaways — **the motion graphics ARE the A-roll and the
  footage becomes B-roll.** This inversion is normal and correct; it is the
  hybrid format.
- So when the visual narration carries the meaning, treat the graphics as the
  spine: plan them first, bind them to the words, and let the footage serve them.

## ADVANCED FEATURE USE-CASES (mandatory — the professional toolset)

**"Mandatory" means: if the concept needs it, you use it.** These are the
features that separate a professional edit from an amateur one. Reading
"mandatory" is the prompt to reach for the feature; using the feature is what
makes the video hold up. Full guide + terminal recipes:
`ADVANCED-FEATURE-USE-CASES.md`.

**Timeline & structure** — **multi-track timeline** (layer video/audio/effects,
never a flat single track) · **multi-camera editing** (sync angles, cut on
speaker/action) · **proxy editing** (cut proxies, re-render the same cut list on
the originals) · **batch export** (every ratio from one master) · project
collaboration.

**Motion & animation** — **keyframing** (position, scale, opacity, rotation,
blur on an eased curve) · **motion tracking** (bind text/effects to a moving
object; lowpass the track first) · **masking & rotoscoping** (frame-by-frame
isolation) · **speed ramping / time remapping** (speed curves across a beat) ·
**stabilisation** (2-pass warp) · **frame blending / optical flow** (smooth slow
motion).

**Colour** — **colour correction** (exposure, white balance, contrast FIRST) ·
**colour grading** (the look: LUT, film emulation, split-tone, SECOND) ·
**scopes** (waveform, vectorscope, histogram, RGB parade — grade by the numbers)
· **HDR grading** (only on request; tone-map to SDR for delivery).

**Compositing & effects** — **chroma key** (green/blue removal with spill
suppression and a clean edge) · **compositing / VFX** (combine layers into one
scene) · **3D camera tracking** (solve the move, place 3D in real footage) ·
**advanced transitions & effects** (blur, glow, glitch, light leaks, grain,
chromatic aberration — each timed to a cut or beat).

**Audio** — **noise reduction** (hiss, hum, room tone) · **EQ** (high-pass
dialogue, de-mud, carve space for music) · **audio syncing** (by waveform or
timecode) · **multi-track mixing** (dialogue/music/SFX; duck music 12–18 dB under
voice) · surround/spatial only where the delivery needs it.

**AI & smart** — **auto subtitles** (word-level timing drives captions AND the
narration plan) · **AI background removal** (matte without a green screen) ·
**auto reframing** (re-frame for 9:16 / 1:1 / 4:5 keeping the subject safe) ·
**scene detection & auto cutting** (cut list from scene changes) · **AI
colour/exposure correction** (first pass, then grade by hand).

**Assets & stills** (for every generated image/graphic) — layer-based editing,
layer masks, blending modes · frequency separation (skin retouch) · dodge & burn ·
content-aware fill / object removal · perspective correction · RAW processing ·
tone curves · HDR merge · panorama stitch · AI-assisted selection ·
non-destructive workflow · vector editing (bezier) · gradient mesh · typography
controls (kerning, tracking, leading) · symbol/asset libraries · artboards · grid
systems · multi-format export.

### The Camera Law (mandatory wherever there is a camera)
1. **One camera wrapper only** — all zooms/pans from a single master camera;
   never local ad-hoc transforms on nested elements.
2. **One camera move at a time** — never stack camera transforms.
3. **Every zoom has a reason** — READ / EMPHASIZE / REVEAL / FOLLOW / BREATHE.
   Constant zoom = no zoom.
4. **Do not cut while zoomed** — return to rest or hold the scene.
5. **Motion blur only during fast motion** — `blur = clamp(v*k, 0, max)`, zero at
   rest (start k ≈ 0.012, max ≈ 24 px). **Anchor zoom** sets the origin on the
   target; **follow** keeps the subject in a safe zone with a damped spring.

**The test:** walk the timeline. For each feature the concept needed, ask "is it
there, and is it doing a job?" A missing needed feature — a flat single track, an
ungraded image, a jittery tracked label — means the edit is not finished.

**For this skill:** compositing, 3D camera tracking, chroma key, speed ramping and colour grade.

## MANDATORY FEATURE USE-CASES (the modern standard)

These are not optional extras. Each has a job; if the job is missing, the edit
reads as amateur. Apply what the concept needs — the items marked **★** apply to
almost every build.

**Camera & motion**
- **★ Zoom in (anchor zoom)** — bring a detail to readable size; origin on the
  target; return to rest before the next cut.
- **★ Zoom out (reveal)** — pull back for context after a detail; wide <-> detail
  rhythm is the pacing engine.
- **★ Motion tracing / follow camera** — the camera follows the cursor or the
  action (safe-zone follow, spring-damped); never leave motion under a static
  frame.
- **Slow push** — <=8% over 3-5s for tension.
- **Camera shake on impact** — a brief 2-4 frame shake on a hit.
- **Speed ramp** — slow->fast or fast->slow across a key beat.
- **Motion blur (velocity)** — blur only while fast; exactly 0 at rest.

**Keyframing & animation**
- **★ Keyframe everything** — position, scale, opacity, rotation, blur; nothing
  moves without keyframes and a curve.
- **★ Easing curves (bezier)** — every move eased, never linear; curve the PATH
  (bezier), not just the timing.
- **Mask / wipe reveal** — draw-on reveals, mask transitions, trim-path draws.
- **Parallax / 2.5D depth** — layers move at different rates (<=3-6% travel).
- **Freeze frame / hold** — stop on the moment that matters.

**Text & data**
- **★ Kinetic text / word-pop** — words appear on the beat; one accent keyword
  per line.
- **★ Count-up numbers** — every stat animates to its value on the spoken word.
- **Text tracked to an object** / **text behind the subject** — for hybrid pieces.
- **Callouts & arrows** — draw-on annotations pointing at the thing.

**UI & product (mandatory for ANY demo)**
- **★ Readability zoom** — any UI text the viewer must read renders >=4% of frame
  height (>=44px at 1080p).
- **★ Micro-interactions** — hover, press, ripple, toggle, focus; the UI answers
  the cursor.
- **★ Screen transitions** — push/pull navigation, modal rise + scrim, sheet slide.
- **★ Cursor physics** — bezier path, minimum-jerk timing, overshoot, click anatomy.
- **Comparison split / PiP** — two states side by side.
- **Screen replacement** — UI on a device.

**Edit & finish**
- **★ Cut-on-beat / cut-on-action** — cuts land on the beat or mid-movement.
- **★ A sound for every cut** — whoosh/impact/tick; silence before the biggest hit.
- **★ Correct then grade** — exposure and white balance first, then the look.
- **Seamless loop** — for social/web loops (end state = start state).

**The test:** open the finished timeline and ask, for each ★, "did this build use
it where the concept needed it?" If a needed ★ is missing, the edit is not
finished.

## RENDER GATE — the contact sheet (mandatory before the full render)

**Never render the full video without sign-off.** Before the final render,
extract one frame per second and build a **contact sheet** for approval:

`ffmpeg -i build.mp4 -vf fps=1 sheet/f%04d.jpg`

Then **offer the user a choice of contact-sheet variants** — build 2-3 and let
them pick. The sheet is the cheapest place to catch pacing, composition,
safe-zone and continuity problems; a variant lets the reviewer read the edit the
way that suits them.

### The contact-sheet variants (build at least TWO; label them V1 / V2 / V3)
- **V1 — Classic Grid.** A uniform grid of 1 FPS frames in time order (left to
  right, top to bottom), each frame labelled with its **timestamp**. The baseline
  read of the whole edit at a glance.
- **V2 — Storyboard Filmstrip.** Larger frames laid in horizontal rows over a
  **time ruler**, with **scene-cut ticks** marked on the ruler and a one-line
  **caption** under each frame (what happens in that second). Reads like a
  storyboard; best for reviewing pacing, flow and the beat map.
- **V3 — Pro QC Sheet.** A dense technical sheet: each thumbnail carries its
  **timecode**, a **scene-cut flag**, a **motion/velocity indicator**, and a
  **safe-zone overlay**; a **colour-swatch strip** (the sampled palette) and a
  **summary header** run across the top (duration, shot count, ASL, loudness
  LUFS + true-peak, palette). Best for technical sign-off and continuity.

Build them at whatever aspect suits the cut (grid for a horizontal piece, a
vertical column for 9:16). Keep the Apple Standard chrome and the brand accent.

### The ask (mandatory)
Present the variants and ask the user directly:

> "Here are the contact-sheet variants — V1, V2, V3. **Did you like any of
> these, or shall I generate more variants so you can choose?**"

Then wait. If they want more, generate additional variants. **Render the full
video only after they finalise** — both the variant they prefer and the cut.

## Platform & delivery standards (self-contained reference)
Platform UI and specs change; values are working standards (2026). Where sources disagreed the more conservative value is used. Re-verify before a paid campaign.

### 1. Vertical safe zones (1080×1920)
Safe zones are a *margin*, not a pixel-exact map; they differ per app and Reels
can additionally crop the feed preview to 4:5.
| Zone | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Universal action-safe** | keep faces/products/key action inside the centre ≈ **900×1330** |
| **Universal text-safe** | keep captions, prices, CTAs, legal text inside the centre ≈ **860×1100**, biased slightly above centre |
| **Shorts (measured)** | top ≈ 240px · bottom ≈ 380px (title/Subscribe) · right ≈ 200px (action column) · left ≈ 60px |
| **TikTok / Reels** | bottom caption tray is deep; right button column ≈ 120–200px; Reels feed preview can crop top/bottom ≈ 285px |
| **Rule of thumb** | design for the most restrictive app (Instagram bottom UI); then it works everywhere |
Always preview in the platform's own safe-zone checker/template.

### 2. Audio loudness (ITU-R BS.1770 integrated)
| Destination | Integrated | True peak ceiling |
|---|---|---|
| YouTube long-form, music, web | **−14 LUFS** | **−1 dBTP** (−2 if heavy codec risk) |
| Social vertical (Reels/TikTok/Shorts), mobile | **−16 to −14 LUFS** | −1 dBTP |
| Podcast (stereo) | **−16 LUFS** (−19 mono) | −1 dBTP |
| Broadcast TV | −23 LUFS (EBU R128) / −24 LKFS (ATSC A/85) | −1 to −2 dBTP |
| Streaming/VOD drama spec | −24 to −27 | −2 dBTP |
Use a **true-peak-aware limiter**, not a sample-peak limiter. Dialogue sits
~6–10 dB above music beds; duck music 12–18 dB under voice. Platforms only turn
loud files *down*, so do not chase loudness past the target.

### 3. Picture
- **Frame rate:** keep source rate. 24 = cinematic; 25 = PAL regions; 30 = web/social/talking-head; 50/60 = gaming, sports, screen capture, slow-mo source. Never mix rates without conforming. 180° shutter for live action (shutter ≈ 2× fps).
- **Colour:** Rec.709 / sRGB delivery. Tag colour metadata (`-colorspace bt709 -color_primaries bt709 -color_trc bt709`) so players don't shift gamma. HDR only on explicit request.
- **Resolution:** 1080p minimum, 4K master where source allows. 1080×1920 vertical.
- **Export (H.264):** `-c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 16-18 -pix_fmt yuv420p -profile:v high -movflags +faststart`, AAC 48 kHz 192–320 kbps. Constant frame rate (variable-rate screen recordings must be conformed first).

### 4. Captions & accessibility
- Always deliver a sidecar **SRT/VTT** (accessibility, SEO, translation). Burn captions in only for social-first formats.
- Burned captions: ≤2 lines, ≤ ~42 characters/line, ≤17 chars/sec, minimum cue ≈ 0.84s, high contrast (stroke or box), inside text-safe zone.
- Never rely on colour alone to carry meaning; keep contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for text.
- Flash safety: no more than 3 flashes per second (photosensitivity).

### 5. Pacing benchmarks (average shot length, ASL)
| Style | Typical ASL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Short-form retention | 1–3 s | visual change every 2–4 s |
| Esports / kinetic hype | 0.4–1.5 s | cut on the beat/drop |
| E-commerce / DTC ad | 1.5–3 s | hook ≤ 1 s |
| Talking-head / creator | 3–8 s | visual event every 6–10 s |
| Podcast multicam | 4–10 s | cut on speaker change; reaction shots 1–2 s |
| SaaS demo | 3–6 s | one action per beat |
| Corporate / brand film | 3–6 s (interview 6–20 s) | B-roll 2–5 s |
| Real-estate flagship | 4–8 s | slow, held, gimbal |
| Wedding / event highlight | 2–5 s | emotional beats held longer |
| Luxury / minimalist | 5–12 s | stillness is the point |

### 6. Delivery checklist (every skill)
Hook/first frame verified · loudness + true peak measured, not guessed · safe
zones checked in platform overlay · captions file delivered · colour tags set ·
CFR confirmed · file plays on a phone in sound-off AND sound-on.

## 6. QA
Every figure sourced and dated · risk text verbatim and legible · no price predictions · product visuals real or disclosed · captions delivered. Director's review: would the target viewer understand and trust this in the first 5 seconds?

## 7. Hard limits
No financial advice, no return or price promises, no invented metrics, no endorsements of tokens. Risk disclosures verbatim. Disclose mockups/recreations. No voice generation.
